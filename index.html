            <h3>Avg IQ per Country</h3>
            <p>
                • Constructed a Machine Learning model capable of predicting average IQ based on socio-economic and educational indicators.<br>
                • Employed mean imputation to address missing values, ensuring a complete and accurate dataset.<br>
                • Encoded categorical variables like continent to enhance compatibility with machine learning algorithms.<br>
                • Compared predicted IQ values with actual values using a DataFrame.<br>
                • Calculated the Mean Squared Error (MSE) using mean_squared_error() to quantify the model's performance.
